Code first runs an alignment on extracted FASTA file sequences of desired length, then creates a distance matrix based on similarities between sequences using principal coordinate analysis, which is then mapped out.

Contains code for the full version, and a version where it splits up the full data set and then has the maps overlaid.

Does not include any FASTA sequences.
